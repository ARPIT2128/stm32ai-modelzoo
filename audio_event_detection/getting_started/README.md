# __Audio event detection Getting Started__
Two different Getting Started packages are included. One uses ThreadX, and the other FreeRTOS.

The FreeRTOS Getting Started is licensed under BSD-3, while the other one is mostly licenced under SLA-44.
The FreeRTOS Getting Started also includes a few code architecture changes, to make it compatible with X-Cube-AWS.

Apart from these few differences, the application code is the same in both Getting Starteds. 
The performance of your model on the board will be the same no matter which Getting Started you use.
