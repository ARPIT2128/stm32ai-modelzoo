# Audio event detection STM32 model deployment

This tutorial shows how to quantize and deploy your pre-trained keras model on an STM32 board using *STM32Cube.AI*.
This tutorial will cover also how to deploy a model from **ST public model zoo** directly on your *STM32 board*.

In this v1 of the model zoo, deployment of a quantized model on STM32 is not yet covered. Please wait warmly for future versions ! 

As of now, the deploy.py script does not do much.
