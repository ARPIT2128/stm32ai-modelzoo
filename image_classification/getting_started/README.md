# __Image classification getting started__

The purpose of this package is to enable image classification application on a STM32 board.

This project provides an STM32 microcontroller embedded real time environnement to execute [X-CUBE-AI](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-ai.html) generated model targeting image classification application.

## __Before you start__

### __Hardware and Software environment__

In order to run this image classification application examples you need to have the following hardware:

- [STM32H747I-DISCO](https://www.st.com/en/product/stm32h747i-disco) discovery board
- [B-CAMS-OMV](https://www.st.com/en/product/b-cams-omv) camera bundle

Only this hardware is supported for now

### __Tools installations__

This getting started needs [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-ides/stm32cubeide.html) as well as [X-CUBE-AI](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-ai.html) `v7.3.0`


You can find the info to install the tools in the parents [README](../scripts/deployment/README.md) of the deployment part and the general [README](../../README.md) of the model zoo. 


## __Deployment__

### __Generate C code from tflite file__

This repo does not provide the AI C-model generated by X-CUBE-AI.

The user needs to generate the AI C-model.

It is directly generated by the deployment script of the model zoo.

### __Build and deploy__

You should use the deploy.py script to automatically build and deploy the program on the target (if the hardware is connected).

You can launch the `Application\STM32H747I-Discovery\STM32CubeIDE\.project` with STM32CubeIDE. With the IDE you can modify, build and deploy on the target.

## __Getting started deep dive__

The purpose of this package is to enable image classification application on a STM32 board. 

This package also provides a feature-rich image processing library ([STM32_ImageProcessing_Library](./Middlewares/ST/STM32_ImageProcessing_Library/) software component).

### __Processing workflow__

The software executes an image classification on each image captured by the camera. The framerate depends on the inference time


![processing Workflow schema](_htmresc/algoProcessing.drawio.svg)

Captured_image: Image From the camera

Network_Preprocess: 3 steps:
   -  ImageResize: rescale to the resolution needed by the network
   -  PixelFormatConversion: Convert Image input (usually RGB565) to needed color channels (RGB888 or Grayscale)
   -  PixelValueConversion: Convert to pixel types used by the network (uint8 or int8)

HxWxC : Height, Width and Number of color channels: format defined by the given network

Network_Inference: Call AI C-model network

Network_Postprocess: Call Output_Dequantize to convert the output to the right output type (only float32 for now)

### __Memory layout__

The application software uses different buffers. The following diagram describes how there are used and which functions interact with it. 


![Memory Layout schema](_htmresc/MemoryLayout.png)



### __Model configuration__

The `'<getting-start-install-dir>/Application/STM32H747I-Discovery/Inc/CM7/ai_model_config.h'` file contains configuration information.

This file is generated by the deploy.py script.

The number of output class for the model:

```C
#define NB_CLASSES          (5)
```

The dimension of the model input tensor:

```C
#define INPUT_HEIGHT        (128)
#define INPUT_WIDTH         (128)
#define INPUT_CHANNELS      (3)
```

A table containing the list of the labels for the output classes:

```C
#define CLASSES_TABLE const char* classes_table[NB_CLASSES] = {\
   "daisy" ,   "dandelion" ,   "roses" ,   "sunflowers" ,   "tulips"}\
```

The type of resizing algorithm that should be used by the preprocessing stage:

```C
#define NO_RESIZE                   (0)
#define INTERPOLATION_NEAREST       (1)

#define PP_RESIZING_ALGO       INTERPOLATION_NEAREST
```
 In the version V1.0 of the package, only the nearest neighbor algorithm is supported.

The pixels values offset and scale for the input frame to fit the training data of the neural network: 
```C
#define PP_OFFSET       (-1.0f)
#define PP_SCALE       (127.5f)
```

Input frame aspect ratio algorithms:
```C
#define KEEP_ASPECT_DISABLE            0
#define KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_CROP         1
#define KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_WITH_BORDERS 2

#define ASPECT_RATIO_MODE KEEP_ASPECT_DISABLE
```

The pixel color format that is expected by the neural network model: 

```C
#define RGB_FORMAT        (1)
#define BGR_FORMAT        (2)
#define GRAYSCALE_FORMAT  (3)
#define PP_COLOR_MODE    RGB_FORMAT
```

Data format supported for the input and/or the output of the neural network model: 
```C
#define UINT8_FORMAT     (1)
#define INT8_FORMAT      (2)
#define FLOAT32_FORMAT   (3)
```

Data format that is expected by the input layer of the quantized neural network model (only UINT8 and INT8 formats are supported in V1.0):
```C
#define QUANT_INPUT_TYPE    INT8_FORMAT
```

Data format that is provided by the output layer of the quantized neural network model (only FLOAT32 format is supported in V1.0):
```C
#define QUANT_OUTPUT_TYPE    FLOAT32_FORMAT
```


The rest of the model details will be embedded in the `.c` and `.h` files generated by the tool [X-CUBE-AI](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-ai.html). 

### __Image processing__

The frame captured by the camera is in a standard video format. As the neural network needs to receive a square-shaped image in input, three solutions are provided to reshape the captured frame before running the inference
- KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_DISABLE: the frame is compacted to fit into a square with a side equal to the height of the captured frame. The aspect ratio is modified. 

![KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_DISABLE](_htmresc/KEEP_ASPECT_DISABLE.png)
- KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_CROP: the frame is cropped to fit into a square with a side equal to the height of the captured frame. The aspect ratio remains but some data is lost on each side of the image. 

![KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_CROP](_htmresc/KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_CROP.png)
- KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_WITH_BORDERS: the frame is filled with black borders to fit into a square with a side equal to the width of the captured frame. The aspect ratio remains. 

![KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_WITH_BORDERS](_htmresc/KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO_WITH_BORDERS.png)


## __Limitations__

- Supports only Cube-AI 7.3.0
- Supports only the STM32H747I-DISCO board with B-CAMS-OMV camera module.
- Supports only neural network model whom size fits in SoC internal memory
- Supports only 8-bits quantized model
- Input layer of the quantized model supports only data in UINT8 or INT8 format
- Output layer of the quantized model provides data in only FLOAT32 format
- Limited to STM32CubeIDE / arm gcc toolchain; IAR and Keil are coming.
- Manageable through STM32CubeIDE (open, modification, debug)
