# Image classification STM32 model zoo


## Directory components:

* [getting_started](getting_started/README.md) contains an application template for image classification.
The user must first run the [deploy.py](scripts/deployment/deploy.py) script before running it. See deployment [README.md](scripts/deployment/README.md)
* [models](models/README.md) a collection of optimized pretrained models for different image classification use-cases.
* [scripts](scripts/README.md) contains tools to train, evaluate and deploy your model on your STM32 target.
